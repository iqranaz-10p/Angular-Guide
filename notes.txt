directives ---> enhancement to elements
types --> attribute directive (built-in ngModel)
          structural directive (built-in ngIf)

custom directive
    inject 
    @Directive({
        selector: 'component[directive name]' --> selector: 'a[appAuth]'
    })

    have constructor
    can have some functions trigerred on events
    can have inputs

effect(()={}) --> angular core and works if something changes

can be standalone and if using module will be exported and imported through modules

inject templateRef and viewContainerRef if using structural directive --> it mentions where to render what
